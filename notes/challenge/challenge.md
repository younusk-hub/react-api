## Challenge

The challenge is to update your app to request users based on their gender.

- Can you implement it with useEffect?
- Look at the [randomUser API docs](https://randomuser.me/documentation). You should be able to add a query param to the URL to get users based on their gender.
- Use the `<RadioButtons/>` component to show these three options All, Female and Male. 
- When one is clicked you should only see that gender on the page.
